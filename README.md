# PTSharp
C# port of pt: a go path tracer

PTSharp is a C# port of path tracer pt by Michael Fogleman (https://github.com/fogleman/pt). This port was done as part of an attempt to learn Go and to understand better the original path tracer codebase.

Getting Started:
- Visual Studio 2022 with .NET 8.0

Status:
- Multithreading is stable
- Added viewport using Silk .NET
- Replaced System.Drawing.Common with SkiaSharp
- Initial support for Intel OIDN on Windows

My thanks go out to Michael Fogleman for his wonderful work.
